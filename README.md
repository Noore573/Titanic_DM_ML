# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢


![Survival Rate Chart](dataset-card.jpg)

This project explores the classic **Titanic dataset** to analyze passenger survival patterns using **data mining techniques** and to **train multiple machine learning models** for prediction.

## 📊 Overview

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that contains data about the passengers aboard the Titanic. This project involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Visualization of survival trends
- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is available from [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

Features include:
- Passenger class, sex, age
- Siblings/spouses aboard
- Parents/children aboard
- Fare, embarked location, etc.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA includes:
- Handling missing values
- Analyzing survival rates based on features
- Visualizing key trends (e.g., survival by gender, class, age)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Several ML models were trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model performance was compared using accuracy and cross-validation scores.

## 📈 Results

Each model’s performance was evaluated and compared to determine the most effective one for predicting survival. Insights and metrics are included in the notebook.

## 🧪 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
